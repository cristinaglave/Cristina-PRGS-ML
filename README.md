For this homework, we'll use the [National Risk Index (NRI) dataset](https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/org/rand.org/threads/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlRocmVhZCIsImlkIjoiMzAxNTAzNTcxNjI0NzU1MiJ9?trk_copy_link=V2), which identifies U.S. communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards. Developed by FEMA with academic, governmental, and industry partners, it provides county-level data across the U.S.

We'll also use the [CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from 2022](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html), which highlights demographic and socioeconomic factors like poverty and housing that impact communities facing hazards. This is also county-level data for the entire U.S.

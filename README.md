For this homework, we'll use the National Risk Index (NRI) dataset, which identifies U.S. communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards. Developed by FEMA with academic, governmental, and industry partners, it provides county-level data across the U.S.

We'll also use the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from 2022, which highlights demographic and socioeconomic factors like poverty and housing that impact communities facing hazards. This is also county-level data for the entire U.S.
